I am an East Coast based _full-stack engineer_ specializing in creating exceptional user experiences and user interfaces with modern Javascript frameworks. Typescript and type-safety diehard. Currently on the hunt to join a new team of passionate and talented engineers to build beautiful and performant web applications.

Leftist and [_artist too_](https://jessewinton.com).
