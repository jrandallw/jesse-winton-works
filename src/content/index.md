I am an East Coast based _[full-stack engineer](https://github.com/thejessewinton)_ specializing in creating exceptional user experiences and user interfaces with modern Javascript frameworks. Typescript and type-safety diehard.

Currently on the hunt to join a new team of passionate and talented engineers to build beautiful and performant web applications.

Formerly head of engineering at _[VeroSkills](https://veroskills.com)_. Also, take a second and checkout _[my resume](/docs/resume.pdf)_, I put a lot of time into it.

Leftist and [_artist too_](https://jessewinton.com).
