Hello, Cosmos Team!

## What I've Built

Rupture is a work-in-progress application that I've been building over the last few weeks. As far as the tech stack goes, it's built with, Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind, Radix, tRPC, Drizzle, Neon PostgreSQL, and is deployed on Vercel. It’s a great example of the type of work that I love doing, and is an example of a full-stack application that I’ve built entirely myself. With my last role as a Design Engineer, with this I want to highlight that I'm just as much an engineer as I am a designer, and that I'm capable of working on complicated products, like Cosmos.

## Links

Below are the pertinent links, both to view it live and to browse through the source code.

- [Live App: https://rupture-app.vercel.app](https://rupture-app.vercel.app)
- [Source Code: https://github.com/thejessewinton/rupture](https://github.com/thejessewinton/rupture)

Please note that due to the nature of the app, running it in your local environment would need some setup, as it would require access to my Vercel dashboard and the environment variables. If you want to run it locally, please let me know, and I can get you set up.

## The App's Limitations & Roadmap

The app is not yet feature complete, and there are a number of things that I still need to build out. In the near future, as I have free time, I plan to add things like a good onboarding flow, more robust data visualization, and useful calculations of lifts based on existing data.

Thank you so much in advance for your time and attention on this, and please don't hesitate to reach out should you have questions!
