Hello Everett and the Anthropic design team! My name is Jesse Winton, and in case you skipped the [homepage](https://jessewinton.works), I'm a Design Engineer based in New York City. I specialize in building exceptional user experiences with modern frameworks, and I'm diehard for Typescript and Tailwind.

I'm reaching out because I'm excited about the Web Engineer role that Anthropic is currently hiring for, and I would love the opportunity to join your team.

## About Me

There's going to be a lot here about my experience as an engineer, so I'll give you a quick breakdown of who I am outside of that work.

- I have a BA in Musical Theatre, and since leaving school in 2021 I've worked professionally almost non-stop, although I'm on a long-term hiatus to focus on playwriting, and getting produced. I'm a member of two theatrical unions, the Dramatist's Guild, and Actor's Equity Association.
- I love Olympic weightlifting, and I've been training for about 10 years now. I have yet to compete, but I'm hoping to do so in the future.
- I love the abstraction of Design Engineer; the idea of being able to work on both the design and the development of a project is appealing to me and has been a great way to leverage my skills and interest in both areas.
- I can do a killer impression of [Hugh Jackman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfjhzV1Sd14&ab_channel=Rodgers%26Hammerstein) in the 1999 West End revival of Rodger's and Hammerstein's classic "Oklahoma!"

## Recent Projects

Up until just a few weeks ago, I was a Senior Design Engineer at PlanetScale, helping to design and develop our home on the web at [planetscale.com](https://planetscale.com). A couple of the particular projects I got to build:

- **Global search**: if you hit `âŒ˜+K` anywhere on the site, you'll see PlanetScale's global search, which I was in charge of. It's built using Tailwind (as is all of planetscale.com), the [`cmdk`](https://cmdk.paco.me) package, and a s\*\*t ton of custom server-side code to automatically extract AST content from our docs, blog posts, and courses, which were made with Markdoc, and generate an index of records that could be searched. Since that went live, there have been upwards of 40,000 monthly searches across 13,000 individual records.
- **Resources**: The last project I got to build at PlanetScale, before the layoffs, was the [Resources hub](https://planetscale.com/resources). This was a replacement for a third-party service that we had been using and was built with many of the same principles from the Global search. The initial design was done by [Yuri Hong](https://yurihong.com), a Brand Designer on the team, and through iterating on the experience, like always, we did a fair bit of design in code to create the best possible in-browser experience.
- **Pricing**: When we launched the Scaler Pro plan, we wanted a [redesigned pricing page](https://planetscale.com/pricing); working alongside [Skullface](https://skullface.me), our Head of Brand, I helped build out the logic that allows for potential customers to select cluster and storage sizes, calculating and displaying the price update dynamically in real-time. I pushed to have the pricing data load from an API route in the internal admin panel, rather than hardcoding it into the site, so that the data would always be in sync with leadership and would reflect pricing updates automatically.

## Conclusion

I hope that this gives you a decent sense of my recent experience, the kind of work that I'm passionate about, and what I could bring to the Anthropic team; I think it's a lot. If you have any questions, or if you'd like to see more of my work, please don't hesitate to reach out to me!
